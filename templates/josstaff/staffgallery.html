    Join Our Story is a new California benefit organization whose mission is to help older adults fill their lives with
    creative expression, supportive social connections and positive recognition in American culture and society.   JOS
    is pursuing this mission by developing an accessible, compelling online platform where people can enjoy, create, and
    share content. The vision is to develop a slate of dramatic and instructional programming, produced by professionals
    and supplemented by users, that fosters engagement.<br><br>

    Our creative storytelling course delivers a cornerstone, which has evolved from tests conducted at diverse senior
    communities in California  (in Burbank and Compton).  This course has received overwhelmingly positive feedback and
    is ready for widespread use in other communities.<br><br>

    The Join Our Story course, in line with its overall mission, helps heighten individuals' social engagement, improve
    their mental acuity, and increase their enjoyment of daily life. The workshops, exercises and activities on
    storytelling promote creativity and prosocial behavior.  Course pedagogy facilitates a broad range of ability levels
    through easy-to-use tools and fun assignments that encourage the participants and prompt interaction with others.
    Further, templates and examples are available to overcome initial hesitation and provide boosts as needed.<br><br>

    Though many writing programs exist, the Join Our Story course is the first developed specifically to enhance the
    quality of life for older adults and is designed to foster a large and ongoing community.  In particular, the
    storytelling aspect centers on social interaction, which includes motivational and cognitive support.  Our
    curriculum developer is an author and educator with expertise in educational technology; the team also includes
    professionals from academia, social services, fitness, and entertainment.  Our staff has worked as teachers,
    scientific researchers, professional writers, and leaders of both nonprofit and international organizations. They
    are compassionate individuals dedicated to the mission of helping older adults and their friends and families lead
    creative, connected, and healthy lives.<br><br>
